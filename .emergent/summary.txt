The AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for A.V.K. SPORT, a hockey equipment company, focusing on a catalog with inquiry forms. Initial development involved creating a comprehensive frontend with mock data, including pages for Home, Catalog, Calculator, Order Form, Form Designer, Portfolio, About, and Contacts. Key challenges included debugging  errors and persistent image loading issues due to CORS policies, which were resolved by switching to  placeholders. The AI iterated heavily on design, responding to user feedback on branding (logo changes, company name updates, A.V.K. SPORT text addition) and color palette adjustments (from initial, to bright sports colors, then to a more subdued, professional sports theme). Most recently, a full administrative panel, including a dashboard, product management, order management, portfolio, users, and settings pages, was implemented. The current task involves refining the site's styling to be less vibrant, aligning with a more professional aesthetic.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a full-stack application for A.V.K. SPORT, a hockey equipment manufacturing company.
**Core Functionality:**
*   A product catalog with a request form for price calculation.
*   Full website sections: Home, Product Catalog, About Us, Contacts, Portfolio of completed orders, Section for wholesale clients.
*   A cost calculator (allowing selection of product type, quantity, logo printing).

*   An admin panel to manage the website, similar to a reference clothing shop project, with dashboards, product/order/portfolio/user management, and settings.
**Design Preferences:**
*   Initially, the user requested brighter, sportier colors, and modifications to the ЛВК branding (changed to АВК, then A.V.K. SPORT).
*   Later, the user requested the design be less bright and more professional.
*   Multiple logo replacement iterations were performed.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack architecture with separate  (React) and  (FastAPI) directories.



-   : The FastAPI backend entry point.
    -   Handles API routing, MongoDB connection, CORS middleware.
    -   **Changes**: Added  and  Pydantic models. Implemented  POST and GET endpoints for basic database interaction, intended for health checks or basic data storage.
-   : Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes**:  was installed for the frontend but no changes were explicitly made here during the trajectory.
-   : The main React application file.
    -   Sets up  and . Defines the root route () and includes  component.
    -   **Changes**: Routes for all user-facing pages (, , , , , ) and admin pages (, , , , , , ) were added. The  component now wraps the admin routes.
-   : Global CSS file for Tailwind and custom styles.
    -   Defines Tailwind's  directives and custom CSS variables for color themes.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to reflect the elegant-RetroVibe-commerce design guidelines, incorporating a sophisticated color palette (Warm Sage, Soft Taupe, Rich Chocolate, Charcoal, Cream White) and specific typography (The Seasons Light, Montserrat Classic). This includes changes for button colors, background colors, and text colors. Later, adjusted again to be less bright with more subdued sports colors.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on refining the site's overall aesthetic based on the user's feedback, сделай стилистику сайта менее яркой (make the site's style less bright).

Before this, a full administrative panel was developed, accessible at . This admin panel includes:
*   A Dashboard for statistics on orders, products, revenue, and clients, featuring interactive sales charts and category distribution pie charts (using Recharts).
*   Product Management for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting items with search and filter capabilities.
*   Order Management displaying all orders with status filtering, status modification, and modal details.
*   Sections for Portfolio, Users, and Settings.

The frontend is fully built with mock data, including all main user-facing pages: Home, Catalog, Calculator, Order Form, Form Designer, Portfolio, About Us, and Contacts. All interactive elements work on the frontend using mock data. The site has gone through several design iterations, including:
*   Transition from initial generic design to vibrant sports colors, and then to a more professional, subdued sports palette.
*   Multiple logo updates, including text addition (A.V.K. SPORT) and size adjustments.
*   Resolution of image loading issues (CORS blocks) by replacing external images with  placeholders, ensuring visual content loads correctly.
The current state is that the frontend, including the new admin panel, is functionally complete with mock data and adheres to the latest design adjustments. The AI's last action was to acknowledge the request for less bright styling and begin modifying the color palette.
