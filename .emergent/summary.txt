The AI engineer's work documents a significant evolution of the A.V.K. SPORT e-commerce application, moving from initial feature completion to iterative, user-driven refinement. The core task transitioned from styling and minor bug fixes to tackling deep-seated architectural problems and implementing major new features.

A recurring theme was debugging visual and functional discrepancies between the local development environment and the user's experience. This was most evident in the multi-stage effort to fix broken images, which began as a CORS issue with external placeholders, evolved into using self-contained SVG placeholders, and culminated in a crucial architectural change: modifying the homepage to fetch dynamic image URLs from the backend API instead of relying on static mock data.

Other key achievements include a complete refactoring of the price calculator from a single-item form to a multi-item list-based system, and resolving persistent cart-related bugs by correcting state management logic in both the  (removing a hardcoded fallback) and  (implementing an event-driven counter). The final phase involved a comprehensive on-page SEO overhaul, adding new components (, , ), keyword-rich content, and optimizing page structures, which was interrupted mid-verification by a system reset.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build and refine a full-stack e-commerce application for A.V.K. SPORT, a hockey equipment supplier.

**Core Features:**
- A public-facing website with pages for Home, Catalog, About, Contacts, Portfolio, Order Form, and a dynamic Price Calculator.
- A comprehensive admin panel for managing products, orders, users, media (images, reviews), site settings (like logos and hero images), and legal pages.
- Standard e-commerce functionality, including a shopping cart and detailed product pages.

**Key Implementation Details & User-Driven Enhancements:**
- **Design:** The entire site must adhere to a modern, minimalist Short Par 4 aesthetic, characterized by a black, white, and gray color palette, clean typography, and ample whitespace.
- **Calculator:** Evolved from a simple form to a multi-item calculator, allowing users to add multiple products with different quantities and sizes to get a cumulative cost estimate.
- **Dynamic Content:** The homepage's hero image and hockey club logos must be dynamically fetched from the backend, manageable via the admin panel.
- **Cart Functionality:** The shopping cart and its header icon must accurately reflect the contents stored in , persisting state correctly across sessions and page reloads.
- **SEO:** The site must be optimized for search engines, including the creation of , , and extensive on-page SEO enhancements (keyword-rich content, optimized headers, alt tags, breadcrumbs, FAQ, and testimonials).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack:** React (Vite), FastAPI (Python), MongoDB.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, custom CSS for animations () and mobile responsiveness.
- **Frontend State Management:** React hooks (, ),  for cart persistence, and custom window events () for cross-component state synchronization.
- **Routing:** React Router DOM, including dynamic path-based components like .
- **Backend:** Pydantic models for data validation,  for async file operations, and API routing with an  prefix.
- **SEO:** On-page optimization techniques, , and  generation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with separate  and  directories.



- ****
  - **Importance:** The main landing page, and the focus of significant architectural changes.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Evolved from using static data from  to dynamically fetching site settings (hero image, hockey club logos) from the backend via an API call in . A complex carousel for hockey club logos was added with monochrome/color hover effects and separate logic for desktop (auto-scroll) and mobile (touch-scroll + auto-scroll). New SEO-focused components (, ) and a large block of keyword-rich text were integrated.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Core business logic tool for users.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Completely refactored from a simple, single-item form into a complex, multi-item calculator. State was changed to manage an array of items. The UI was split into a form for adding items and a dynamic list displaying the items, with a running total and removal functionality. Discounts and optional logo uploads were removed per user request.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Critical for the e-commerce checkout flow.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Fixed a critical bug where the cart would repopulate with mock data after being emptied. The hardcoded fallback data was removed. The UI was completely restyled to match the Short Par 4 theme, removing outdated blue color schemes.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Provides global navigation and key UI feedback (cart count).
  - **Summary of Changes:** The cart item counter was changed from a hardcoded value to a dynamic state (). It now initializes from  and updates in real-time by listening to a custom  event and the global  event, ensuring synchronization with  and other components. Logo size was also increased.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The entry point for the React app, crucial for SEO.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Meta tags (title, description, keywords, Open Graph) were added and optimized. The favicon link was corrected to point to a local file () to fix an update issue and enable cache-busting.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Initially the primary source of all frontend data.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Product image URLs were changed multiple times to resolve loading issues, finally settling on reliable inline SVG placeholders. Product descriptions and alt tags were expanded for SEO purposes. The main company logo URL was updated to the new local file.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Defines application-wide layout and routing.
  - **Summary of Changes:** The new  component was added here, rendered based on the current route to provide navigation context on all sub-pages.

<pending_tasks>
- **Backend Development:** The original plan mentioned implementing backend logic for the order form and user management, which has not been explicitly addressed.
- **Content Integration:** The site still uses placeholder SVG images for products in the catalog. A task to integrate actual product images remains.
- **In-depth SEO:** The user-approved SEO plan included creating a blog/articles section and implementing technical optimizations like lazy loading for images, which have not been completed.
- **Finalize Styling:** A full audit to ensure every single component and page strictly adheres to the Short Par 4 style.

<current_work>
Immediately before the system reinitialization, the AI engineer was executing a multi-part, on-page SEO enhancement plan requested by the user. The work focused on enriching the site's content and structure to improve search engine ranking.

**Completed Steps in this phase:**
1.  **Content Expansion:** Added a large, keyword-rich text block and a new FAQ section to .
2.  **Image SEO:** Added descriptive  tags for all product images within  and ensured they were rendered in .
3.  **Social Proof:** Created and integrated a new  component onto the homepage.
4.  **Header Optimization:** Refactored H1 tags across all major pages (, , , etc.) to be more descriptive and SEO-friendly.
5.  **Navigation:** Created and integrated a  component into  to display a navigational path on all pages.

The very last action was initiating a screenshot of the  page () to verify that the newly added Breadcrumbs were displaying correctly. The system crashed before the result of this action was received. The current task is therefore to confirm the successful implementation of all the aforementioned SEO features.

<optional_next_step>
I will analyze the screenshot of the  page to verify the breadcrumbs are implemented correctly and then provide a final summary of the completed SEO tasks before asking the user for the next steps.
